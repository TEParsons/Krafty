# How to install this theme

This theme is a bit more complicated than most as it contains multiple files, but it's no more complicated to install! Here are the steps:

1. [Download](https://www.itprotoday.com/mobile-management-and-security/how-do-i-download-files-github) this whole repo as a `zip` file
2. Extract the contents of the `zip` file (guides for [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc), [Mac](https://www.howtogeek.com/672240/how-to-zip-and-unzip-files-and-folders-on-mac/) and [Linux](https://itsfoss.com/unzip-linux/))
3. In Typora, go to:
    1. Preferences
    2. Appearance
    3. Themes
    4. Open theme folder
4. From the extracted zip file, copy the file `typora/krafty.css` and the folder `typora/krafty` to the theme folder
5. That's it! It's installed! Just restart Typora and it should appear in your Themes menu.

Happy marking down!
