# Commit syntax
As of 1.1.2 I've been trying to stick to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec, with the following types:
- `fix`: Fixing a bug
- `feat`: Adding a feature
- `docs`: Updating documentation
- `refac`: Changing structure without functional changes
- `chore`: Admin type stuff
